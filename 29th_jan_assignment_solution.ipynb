    "Python programming language was developed by Guido van Rossum. He created Python in the late 1980s and released the first version, Python 0.9.0, in 1991. Guido van Rossum is a Dutch programmer and is often referred to as the \"Benevolent Dictator for Life\" (BDFL) of Python, as he led the language's development and made key decisions regarding its design and features for many years. However, in 2018, Guido van Rossum stepped down as the BDFL, and the Python language is now maintained by the Python community through the Python Software Foundation (PSF)."

    "\n",
    "Procedural Programming: Python allows you to write programs using procedural programming techniques, which involve organizing code into functions or procedures that perform specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Python has robust support for object-oriented programming. You can define classes to create objects that encapsulate data and behavior, allowing for code reuse and modularity. Python supports inheritance, polymorphism, and other OOP concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functional Programming: Python supports functional programming concepts, such as treating functions as first-class citizens, higher-order functions, and the ability to use functions as arguments or return values. While not purely functional, Python provides functional programming tools and libraries.\n",
    "Imperative Programming: Python allows imperative programming, where you write code as a series of statements that change the program's state. Imperative programming emphasizes how to achieve the desired result step by step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scripting: Python is often used as a scripting language, enabling you to write scripts to automate tasks or execute commands on a computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Concurrent Programming: Python provides various modules and libraries to support concurrent programming, including multi-threading, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming with async/await syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "Metaprogramming: Python's dynamic nature and rich introspection capabilities enable metaprogramming, where you can write code that manipulates or generates other code at runtime."

The garbage collector is responsible for detecting and freeing objects that are no longer reachable or have circular references (where a group of objects reference each other, but are not reachable from the rest of the program). The garbage collector periodically identifies and collects these unreachable objects, freeing up their memory.\n",
